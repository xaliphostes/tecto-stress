- You can search the stress tensor solution by defining the orientation of the principal stress axes and the stress shape ratio interactively.
- You can evaluate the quality of the solution from the joint analysis of diagrams combining kinematic, statistical, and mechanical information for the data set:

    - The stress tensor flow lines on the unit sphere
