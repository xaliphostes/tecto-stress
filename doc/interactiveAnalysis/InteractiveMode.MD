# Interactive Mode
The interactive mode allows the user to search the stress tensor solution from the joint analysis of diagrams combining kinematic, statistical, and mechanical information for the data set:

    - The stress tensor flow lines on the unit sphere

    - The histogram of angular misifts between measured and calculated microstructures

    - The Mohr circle diagram

    - The multivarible statistical analyses
